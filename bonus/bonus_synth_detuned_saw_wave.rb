# Detuned Saw Wave
# note: note to play (default 52)
# amp: amplitude of sound (default 1)
# pan: position of sound in stereo (default 0)
# attack: amount of beats to reach the full sound amplitude (default 0) [can't be changed once set]
# decay: amount of beats to move from attack_level to sustain_level (default 0) [can't be changed once set]
# sustain: amount of beats to remain at sustain level amplitude (default 0) [can't be changed once set]
# release: amount of beats to move from sustain_level to silent (default 1) [can't be changed once set]
# attack_level: amplitude level reached after attack phase (default 1) [can't be changed once set]
# decay_level: amplitude level reached after decay phase (default sustain_level) [can't be changed once set]
# sustain_level: amplitude level reached after sustain phase (default 1) [can't be changed once set]
# env_curve: shape of the curve between level in the envelope; 1=linear, 2=exponential, 3=sine, 4=welch, 6=squared, 7=cubed (default 2) [can't be changed once set]
# cutoff: MIDI note representing the highest frequencies allowed to be present in the sound (default 100)
# detune: distance in MIDI notes between components of sound (default 0.1)
