# Synth: A sine wave with a fundamental frequency which is modulated at audio rate by
# another sine wave with a specific modulation, division and depth.
# Defaults: attack: 0; decay: 0; release: 1.0; attack_level: 1; sustain_level: 1; env_curve: 2;
# Additional Defaults: cutoff: 100; divisor: 2; depth: 1
# More Explanation from:
# www.indiana.edu/~emusic/fm/fm.htm
# below audio-rate = approximately 20 Hz = sub-audio rate = vibrato (change in pitch vs. tremolo, change in volume)
# audio rate = > 20 Hz
# "When the rate of the modulating oscillator is tuned above 20 Hz, or at
# an audio rate, very interesting things happen to the sound. Additional
# frequencies called sidebands appear symmetrically around the carrier
# frequency. Those above the carrier frequency are called upper sidebands
# and below, lower sidebands. In essence, as will be seen below, some of
# the energy of the carrier frequency is being stolen to create these
# additional frequencies.
